# AI-Driven Chatbot for Simulated Police Investigations

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI-driven chatbot designed to assist in simulated police investigations. The chatbot processes natural language queries and provides context-aware responses using both provided and AI-generated situational data. This system aims to enhance decision-making and streamline information access in hypothetical law enforcement scenarios.

## Features
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Processes user queries with accuracy.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Generates responses based on investigation-specific intents.
- **AI-Generated Situational Data**: Simulates real-world scenarios for educational purposes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for easy interaction and query resolution.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cybermad7373/ChatBot_optimized.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook chatbot.ipynb
   ```
4. Launch the chatbot interface (if applicable):
   ```bash
   python app.py  // under development
   ```

---

## Usage
1. Open the chatbot interface or interact via the notebook.
2. Enter queries related to simulated police investigations, such as:
   - "Where was the suspect last seen?"
   - "What evidence has been collected?"
3. Receive context-aware and relevant responses.
